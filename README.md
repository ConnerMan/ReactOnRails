React on Rails
==================
Code for the "React On Rails" presentation I gave at  [BostonRb](http://bostonrb.org) on 9/8/15.

The associated slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/connerman/react-on-rails) on SpeakerDeck.

---------

Contains examples for integrating [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) into a Rails app via the `react-rails` gem.

To jump to the interesting "Reacty" bits take a look at:
- `/app/assets/components/*.jsx` React components
- `app/views/post/*.html.erb` Views utilizing the `react_component`  helper from react-rails
- `examples` has sections of code that were used for slides.
